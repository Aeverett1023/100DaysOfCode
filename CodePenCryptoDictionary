//2-1-22 Today I edited sections H-N for formatting, and added several definitions. I have much more to add, and of course, much formatting to do. Day 1, not terrible. Will continue other projects.

<section id="main-doc">
  <header><h3>A</h3></header>
    <body id="01">
      <p><dfn>Algorithmic Stablecoins</dfn> are stablecoins controlled by a smart contract, which solves USDTs little auditing problem, because anyone can audit the code fairly easily. Some work off of the "money printer" principle like USDT, where for every dollar put in, one stablecoin is minted, but others change the amount of coin in your wallet so that it’s always consistent with $1 even when the value of the coin fluctuates.</p>
      <p><dfn>AML</dfn> is short for “Anti-Money Laundering”, a set of practices many cryptoassets employ to attempt to ensure that their assets aren’t used in criminal activity.</p>
      <p><dfn>API</dfn> is “Application Programming Interface”, and it is how two programs talk to each other.</p>
      <p><dfn>Arbitrage</dfn> uses small variances in the price of a cryptoasset between exchanges. So, let’s say on Uniswap, $DOGE is trading at $0.20, but it’s trading for $0.24 over on Sushiswap. You could buy a large quantity of $DOGE at Uni, and sell it on $Sushi for an instant $0.04 profit. We call this arbitrage.</p>
      <p><dfn>Asset</dfn> is anything of value.</p>
      <p><dfn>ASIC</dfn> is an application specific integrated circuit. Basically, it is a piece of hardware designed for the sole purpose of mining BTC. It outperforms a GPU or CPU, and is excited expensive, effectively pushing the hobbyist miner out of the space of BTC mining. LTC fought against this by switching to Scrypt, and an ASIC was quickly created for Scrypt as well.</p>
      <p>In <dfn>Asymmetric Encryption</dfn>, there are two keys: one that everyone knows (“public key”), and one that only the issuer of the keys knows (“private key”). These keys are mathematically related, and they cannot be used to discover each other (that is, if you know the public key, you can’t use it to figure out the private key). Anyone can encrypt data with the public key, but it can only be decrypted with the private key.<p>
      <p><dfn>Aurora</dfn> is the NEAR version of an EVM, and helps to allow ETH to move over to the NEAR network and back to ETH.</p>
      <p><dfn>Authority</dfn> is one of Cialdini’s principles: imagine if crypto actually got US government endorsement. It would be a huge boon, because the authority of the US government would be behind it, and people would see it as inherently more safe, regardless of any change in the underlying architecture.</p>
      <p><dfn>Automated Market Maker</dfn> is how most DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges) work; the exchange is managed almost entirely by a computer program instead of by an organization of human beings. There is no banker going, “Why you trying to trade $10M in ETH, Joe?”; just a program who sees your sell order, and sees a bunch of other buy orders for ETH, and fills those buy orders and your sell order, and hands you over the fiat of your choice.</p>
      <p><dfn>Autonomous</dfn> - manually working with enough data to get reproducible results is unwieldy. So, Data scientists use programs to make performing calculations and finding correlations easier. They can then create a program that takes several data sets and compares them to each other in some way to perform an action. Let’s say, we have a program that compares the average price-to-value of $FB versus $TWTR for a year, and whenever $FB is less than $TWTR, it buys 1 share. This program is now “autonomous”, as it acts without human input.</p>
      <p id="02">B</p>
      <p>A <dfn>basis point</dfn> or “bip” is 1/100th of 1%, or 1% of 1%. Not to be confused with basis trading.</p>
      <p><dfn>Basis Trading</dfn> is a trading strategy used when traders believe that derivatives (futures) are mispriced relative to the price of an asset. You’re basically taking someone up on their bet. So let’s say you own 3 BTC and you think that there will be a sudden surge in the supply of BTC in the future, which will drive down the price. You can take out a futures contract to sell the BTC you own at $45k (as someone else is interested in buying a futures contract betting on an increase in BTC). Basically, you’re the lesser-known half of an options trade.</p>
      <p><dfn>Block</dfn> is a chunk of data. It can be any data, but in most blockchains, it is a ledger.</p>
      <p><dfn>Blockchain</dfn> is a chunk of data which is connected to other chunks of data, forming a chain.</p>
      <p><dfn>Blockchain-as-a-Service</dfn> anyone in the computer world knows that some bigger companies are fond of everything as a service, from Software to physical computer Infrastructure: turning something that most people simply own into a service. The blockchain is apparently no different, and Intel, Linux, and IBM work together on a project called ‘Hyperledger Sawtooth’, which basically will run your blockchain for you on the back end, allowing you to focus on the front-end, user-facing problems. I don’t know why this one makes me so uneasy. It’s ok; ignore my existential crisis.</p>
      <p>A <dfn>Blockchain Bridge</dfn> is exactly what it sounds like: it is a way to move assets from one blockchain ecosystem to another one. These are becoming important as the size and quantity of blockchains grow.</p>
      <p><dfn>Blockchain Explorer</dfn> is a piece of software - either on the internet or on a computer - that allows you to see blockchain transactions from specified wallets. Instances include Blockchain . Com ; Blockscan ; Coinpath ; and bitquery.</p>
      <p><dfn>Blue Team/Red Team</dfn>: White hat hackers may team up to run exercises to protect a company’s assets, and they may in these exercises, split into two groups - the attacker and the IT department. The attacking team is traditionally called the “Red Team”, and the defense is the “Blue Team”. A fun aside: when we do this exercise in my home, tradition holds that we dye our hair for the duration of the exercise. Which was hilarious when it didn’t wash out.</p>
      <p><dfn>Botnet</dfn> is exactly what it sounds like; a hacker invades a system and puts a bot on a lot of different computers to form a network of bots.</p>
      <p>A <dfn>bug</dfn> is something that usually doesn’t require any effort on the part of the user but which allows the system to break internally due to a problem with how it was built. Think of it as: an exploit is an unlocked door. A bug is a broken door.</p>
      <p>A <dfn>Bug Bounty</dfn> program is a program where anyone who finds a bug or vulnerability and submits it gets a monetary prize. Sometimes, it’s $50, sometimes it’s $45k, sometimes it’s literally millions of dollars.</p>
      <p><dfn>Burning</dfn> is when a specific number of tokens or coins is rendered unusable. These tokens are considered “burned”, which lowers the circulating or available supply, and theoretically drives up the price by decreasing the supply.</p>
      <p>A <dfn>bus topology</dfn> is one where nodes receive data in a single line sequence: A, B, C, D, E, F. So if there is a message for node D that reads “1010”, that gets passed to A, then B, then C, and finally D, who takes the packet of data. This is really inefficient, as every preceding node has to read the packet prior to it reaching its destination. This is similar to the actual data in the blockchain.</p>
      <p><dfn>Byzantine Fault Tolerance</dfn> is a threshold for how a cryptoasset will achieve consensus, and is different between different cryptoassets, with some having a larger tolerance than others.</p>
      <p><dfn>The Byzantine Problem</dfn> was one introduced early on in computer networking: if a system is made up of nodes, and some of them are likely to fail, how will the system reach an agreement on what data is correct (a consensus)?</p>
      <p id="03">C</p>
      <p><dfn>Canisters</dfn> are what ICP calls its smart contracts, and those are used to develop and deploy software.</p>
      <p><dfn>Capped</dfn> means that the entire supply of a cryptoasset is predetermined. This means there is only a certain amount that will ever exist, leading to scarcity and increasing value.</p>
      <p>A <dfn>cell</dfn> in a solid state drive represents 1 or 2 digits. - either 0, 1, 00, 11, 01, or 10.</p>
      <p><dfn>Cialdini’s Principles</dfn> are put forth in his book Influence, and are commonly associated with marketing and the intelligence/InfoSec community. Because while, yes, they are a great way to conduct marketing, they’re also a good Hacker’s Bible.
      <p><dfn>Circulating Supply</dfn> is the amount of a coin or token that is available to transact with (not including burned or locked tokens).</p>
      <p><dfn>Client</dfn> is the term for a computer that is connecting to the server to use some of the server’s resources.</p>
      <p><dfn>Codebase</dfn>: When two cryptos share a “codebase”, it means that the code that underlies the two assets is the same.</p>
      <p><dfn>Coin</dfn> (v "Token"): coin versus a token. A coin has its own blockchain. It’s its own thing, like the US Dollar. A token utilizes that blockchain to create a currency based on a specific coin. Think of it like the tokens in a casino. Ideally, tokens offer some function: they do their own thing, giving them an inherent value. We call this a “use case”.</p>
      <p><dfn>CoinJoin</dfn> is a mixer, which accepts crypto coming in, and uses a smart contract to anonymize and disburse it.</p>
      <p><dfn>Cold Wallet</dfn> is a term for a wallet for cryptocurrency which is on independent hardware. Unlike here on public, where you buy a certain amount of a cryptocurrency and let it sit in an account, in this form of acquisition, you buy a special piece of hardware that you then connect to your computer, and that hardware is a part of multiple checks to ensure the wallet is actually yours. (If you try to log in to your wallet without it, you'll find that you cannot.)</p>
      <p><dfn>Commit Chain</dfn> see: Plasma</p>
      <p><dfn>Concatenating</dfn> is a big word that might sound scary, but don't fret. It basically means concentrating - you are looking through a set of data or blockchain addresses and eliminating anything that is there more than once. As an example, if I wanted to find the vocabulary words in this post, I could run them through word, alphabetize them, and wind up with a list of words I had used. I could get some interesting data from this, such as there are 11 words that I repeated - 70 non-alphabetized, 59 alphabetized. Or, let’s say I’m looking at blockchain addresses. I can see who had the most back and forth transactions with one specific address by concatenating all the data of all the addresses they do business with.</p>
      <p><dfn>Consensus Mechanism</dfn> is whatever way the cryptoasset solves the problem of how to prove a transaction occurred (for example, how many nodes have to agree that it occurred for it to be written to the blockchain). These can be really simple or really complicated.</p>
      <p><dfn>Consistency</dfn means you have to keep your message consistent. Changing from a stance of, say, “There are plenty of people who died without seizing the day, those silly humans, don’t be like them.” to “Invest your life savings into Mongoose Coin today!” might be a bad marketing strategy.</p>
      <p><dfn>Consortium Blockchains</dfn> are where multiple private companies all contribute to their “invite-only” blockchain, and hence defeat the Byzantine Fault Problem with simple vetting and trust.</p>
      <p><dfn>CPU</dfn> is a Central Processing Unit. Let’s say that we’re playing a game where you try to get a bunch of trains to their stations based upon the color of the train and the station, and I put 4 trains driving along the tracks. You have to keep track of all 4 of those trains until they get to where they’re going, and route them appropriately. That is literally what a CPU does. “Well, mom, that sounds really simple.” Your average game now needs to handle about 16 BILLION trains.</p>
        <p><dfn>Cryptojacking</dfn> is where a hacker takes control of a computer or server and uses the assets on that computer to mine a cryptocurrency.</p>
        <p><dfn>Cryptology</dfn> is the study of encryption and decryption.</p>
        <p><dfn>Curve DAO</dfn> is a governance token on the MATIC network that works to pool large amounts of stablecoins to avoid slippage.</p>
        <p id="04">D</p>
        <p><dfn>DAG</dfn> is a Directed Acyclic Graph. Don’t fear. Basically what this means is that rather than data forming blocks which are then chained together, the data forms a graph, which does not circle back on itself. It looks less like a chain of blocks and more like a tree, with various sizes of branches which separate and then come back to comingle.</p>
        <p><dfn>DAO</dfn> is a decentralized autonomous organization. It uses smart contracts to make decisions about things like hiring, firing, raises, etc, and runs an entire business without human intervention. Usually, this will lean on at least some machine learning to evaluate organizational performance and adjust as needed.</dfn>
      <p><dfn>DAP scheme</dfn> is a Decentralized Anonymous Payment scheme. ZEC is notable for using this, and it simply means that you cannot use a blockchain explorer to find payments in and out of wallets (as it’s fairly easy to de-anonymize a wallet).</p>
      <p><dfn>dApp</dfn> is a decentralized application. What does that mean? Well, it’s the classic argument about how much centralization is ideal, but in the application space. Take Facebook - while it has a user side and is user-driven in many regards, at the end of the day, the Zuck makes a lot of decisions about things like how the application determines what you see first and what you see the most. In a dApp, those decisions would be made by the community, rather than by a central figure. And these shouldn’t be frequent evens - dApps should run mostly by themselves, but the community steps in when necessary.</p>
      <p><dfn>The Dark Web</dfn> is the portion of the internet that you can’t reach via Google or a standard search engine. It has no DNS, no hosted IP, and you have to find it via other means, such as knowing the onion address. As an aside, there’s never been a proven instance of someone using the Dark Web to hire a hitman. Hit man sites are designed to steal money with much lower risk than actually coordinating a murder.</p>
      <p><dfn>Dead Internet Theory</dfn> as seen here: https://youtu.be/DEn758DVF9I and in a referenced post by IluminatiPirate (that I cannot find) is the theory that the internet is “fake”, or more accurately, that the internet has become less of a way for people to interact together and more of a way for AI and ML programs to harvest data from individual users and commoditize peoples’ attention, often at the cost of genuine interaction. Which is less a theory and more of a proven fact; that’s something that we know is happening with Facebook, Twitter, and the likes. But the Dead Internet theory says that most of the users are fake, and cites “studies” that are unlinked that show that the majority of internet traffic is bots and that bots are therefore the main customer of the internet, and the internet has begun to tailor itself for them. Which they refer to as the “inflection”, and it’s a bit of a fallacious argument. The best studies regarding bot traffic come from the Annual Bad Bot Report, and you have to remember that most of the internet traffic good bots are Google - they use bots called web crawlers. https://www.imperva.com/blog/bad-bot-report-2021-the-pandemic-of-the-internet/ So, no the internet isn’t dead. There is no inflection point that has been reached. But, yes, many of us exist online in echo chambers designed to sell us stuff.</p>
      <p><dfn>Deflationary</dfn> in crypto is a little different from deflation in regular economics. Deflationary in crypto is when a cryptoasset is designed to decrease in supply over time. This can be accomplished through having a fixed supply (as many cryptoassets do, with $DOGE being a notable exception), or through regular burning (for example, burning tokens used in transactions, which is fairly popular). Most cryptoassets should be deflationary by default and in general, I would be skeptical of any cryptoasset which is not.</p>
      <p>A <dfn>denial of service</dfn> attack occurs when one or more actors sends a flood of information into a system that is meant to handle limited information, jamming up the flow of data, and stopping the whole operation from working. Think of these like traffic jams. These are harder to accomplish on blockchains because of their distributed nature, but anywhere that there is a bottleneck in the transfer of information, there is a vulnerability to these attacks. Centralized exchanges are also vulnerable to these attacks, and there have been some notable ones that were DOS attacks: Ledf.me and Uniswap, with a combined $25M stolen.</p>
      <p>A <dfn>DEX</dfn> is a decentralized exchange. Basically, a marketplace where people can trade their coins for tokens and their tokens for each other. Examples include UNISWAP and SUSHISWAP. These are different from a "CEX" in that nobody holds on to your crypto assets for you; it is a trade, mediated by a dApp.</p>
      <p>A <dfn>Digital Signature</dfn> uses asymmetric encryption to verify that the data being sent or received is authentic.</p>
      <p><dfn>Distributed Denial Of Service</dfn> attack is a type of hacking attack that builds on a “Denial of Service” concept (where a hacker uses a lot of traffic to shut down a service or site), and uses multiple computers to send the traffic (usually pings) that shuts down the service or site. These are used because if a DOS attack is used and the site identifies who is doing the attack, they can just block that one IP address. But if a hacker is using a Distributed DOS – usually through a botnet, shutting down the traffic and figuring out which traffic is legitimate becomes a lot harder.</p>
      <p>A <dfn>DNS</dfn> is the way most of us use the internet. It allows you to type in, say, public.com, instead of the IP address (a series of numbers and decimals) to access a site.</p>
      <p><dfn>Doomslug</dfn> is the term for the NEAR protocol that allows transactions to be finalized after one block instead of 35.</p>
      <p><dfn>Double-Spending</dfn> has created a lot of negative press for $BTC: the idea that one bitcoin could be spent twice, by simply copying the data. Yet in reality, this would be incredibly unlikely to happen, because when two parties transact in BTC, every single node in the $BTC network acts as a witness to that transaction. There is a timestamp, and every ten minutes, the ledger moves on. This is also a bit of a joke regarding NFTs for those who misunderstand that NFTs are not pictures, but instead the data that is hidden in those pictures.
        <p><dfn>DPA</dfn> is a Data Protection Authority; European countries all have these. These are governmental offices charged with protecting consumer data and investigating breaches. Because they are USED TO dealing with InfoSec, they don’t need a primer on it (as Congress might). Who does that in the United States? No one. Eh, ok. Sometimes, the FTC. That’s right, the Federal Trade Commision governs how well or how sloppily Verizon safeguards your data. (That’s ok, though. It’s not like cyber attacks are common or anything.) So when crypto exec’s go and say we are years behind Europe, that’s probably what they mean. They have contacts; they have people in the Netherlands they can talk to who are familiar with encryption of data and blockchain technology and it’s myriad benefits and risks, and they aren’t being dragged to somebody’s office to talk to someone about Hamster Coin.</p>
      <p id="05">E</p>
      <p><dfn>Ecosystem</dfn> is the system built around the cryptoasset and the individual components of it. Take an online gaming platform like Roblox. In the Roblox ecosystem, you have Robux (in-game currency), the games, the players, the developers of the game, the internet which makes the game possible, the servers owned by the company which hosts the games, and the company itself. All these individuals and pieces of equipment and software interact to create an ecosystem.</p>
      <p><dfn>EIP 1559</dfn> is an Ethereum Improvement Plan, which is meant to address gas fees. Basically, ETH gas is simply incredibly volatile and some times of day, you will pay far too much for gas. Personally, I don’t use ETH in my wallets specifically because of gas fees, so if EIP 1559 addresses it, that’s fantastic. Basically, the way 1559 does this is by setting a minimum and a maximum price, and putting price pressures to try to keep gas prices within those limits. That said, I don’t think it will produce a vast change. Estimations I’ve seen have shown it will likely only improve efficiencies by maybe double. Ultimately, ETH is still a narrow network: capable of handling 15-30 transactions per second. For context, SOL handles 30-60k transactions per second – the difference between ETH and SOL is the difference between dial-up (56 kbps) and WiFi (2 Mbps)</p>
      <p>An <dfn>Emissions Curve</dfn> is the term for the graph that shows how many of a coin or token is in the circulating supply.</p>
      <p><dfn>Encryption</dfn> is the act of taking something that is readable and valuable, and making it difficult for someone who is not intimately involved to understand. This can be accomplished in manifold ways.</p>
      <p>An <dfn>ENS</dfn> functions much like a DNS does for the web, except for crypto payments and assets. So, rather than typing in the very long wallet address, I could type in an alphanumerical string of the creator’s choosing; for example, goldfish.ETH</p>
      <p><dfn>ETH Gas</dfn> for ETH, you have to pay for a transaction to occur. You pay based on how many people are trying to perform transactions and how fast you want that transaction to occur. These fees may sound insignificant, but they can be $150 just for a $20 transaction.</p>
      <p><dfn>EVM</dfn> - let’s say that you have zero resources and you want to make a computer. You could ask a bunch of different computer users if you could use a small piece of their computers power, and cobble together an entire computer, provided you had enough people willing to share resources. Well, that is the “EVM” - the ethereum virtual machine. Several projects use an EVM, including BSC, MATIC, and FTM.</p>
      <p>An <dfn>exploit</dfn> is a problem with the program that allows a bad actor to do… bad actor things, whether that’s stealing money, reading data that they aren’t supposed to have, or taking down the system and preventing further transactions. Think of it as: an exploit is an unlocked door. A bug is a broken door.</p>
      <p id="06">F</p>
      <p>A <dfn>Faucet</dfn> is a way to get a small amount of crypto that you may need for transactional purposes. For example, MATIC has a faucet to cover test transaction costs.</p>
      <p><dfn>Fiat</dfn> is government issued currency.</p>
      <p><dfn>Flash Loan</dfn> is a loan where you use a smart contract to pull a loan, but it must be repaid quickly. It’s not like a traditional loan - take it out, spend it on your home improvement, pay it back. It is essentially a loan geared towards fulfilling arbitrage orders.</p>
      <p><dfn>Forking</dfn> can be thought of like an update to a piece of computer software. Some light changes (Soft Forks) happen all by themselves, like your iPhone updating itself overnight. Other changes (Hard Forks) require an action by all the nodes in the network. Think of this like an expansion pack for a video game, where you have to download and install the software to use it. Hard forks are major updates, patches, or changes, and require every node to change. An example is $ETH, which went from $ETH classic to $ETH 2 after The DAO was hacked. Soft forks can be minor updates, or really any change that is backwards compatible. These are much more common, and are generally seen as safer (though, that is debated.)</p>
      <p><dfn>FUD</dfn> is an acronym in the crypto community that stands for Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt, and it’s something you won’t hear mom say. Why? Well, fear is healthy. Fear keeps us risk-averse. If someone has a fear, that concern should be met with rational empathy, not with an offhanded acronym designed to deride them. Uncertainty should be met with certainty. Confusion should be cleared, light should be shed. Uncertainty is also… not a bad thing. Being uncertain should also not be met with derision. Doubt falls in the same category, but it presents an even more potent concern, because the opposite of doubt in this context is faith, and while faith is good in some areas of your life and can provide comfort when psychological coping is required, faith is not what you should be having in regards to the people who are handling your money. In fact, doubt and distrust are what most people have that causes them to go to crypto in the first place… It’s the whole point of a “trustless” system: you shouldn’t have to have faith! You shouldn’t be giving your money to someone who says, “don’t fear, don’t doubt. It’s fine. Money’s all there. I promise. I can’t show you, but I promise.”</p>
      <p><dfn>Fungibility</dfn> could be called “interchangeability”; dollars are fungible, because you can trade one dollar for an identical dollar, or replace a lost dollar with one that is basically identical. An extension of this is that something is non-fungible if it is truly unique and not exchangeable for another.</p>
      <p id="07">G</p>
      <p><dfn>Generative Art</dfn> is where a computer makes art, given specific input that the artist has precreated, such as variations in eyes, fur fluffiness, and tail. (Using cryptokitties as an example.) The art is run through a code that determines which traits the art piece will have.</p>
      <p><dfn>Github</dfn> is a repository for opensource code and projects. It’s a place to post your work when you’re working with software, or to view the work of others, or to learn and work on projects. It is very popular. So when you see a whitepaper hosted on Git or you see GitDocs, that’s a reputable thing.</p>
      <p><dfn>Governance Utility</dfn> is like Class A shares: for every token you have, you get one vote in the future of the asset, ecosystem, or peoject. Some assets have governance utility, others do not.</p>
      <p><dfn>GPU</dfn> is a graphics processing unit. Unlike a CPU, a GPU divides tasks up among more specialized subcomponents. So, extending the CPU analogy, let’s say that instead of having one big processor processing 16 billion trains, you divided it up and said 1/4th of that processor will handle steam trains. 1/4th will handle passenger trains, 1/4th will handle electric trains, and 1/4th will handle cargo trains. Because you split up the work, each mini processor can specialize in what it’s doing.</p>
      <p><dfn>Guilds</dfn> are another fun term that appears to be coined by NEAR, but the concept is already in use. They’re basically forming a DAO, and there will be guilds that run various sections of the DAO, like an Accounting guild etc. Even in non-DAO assets, this concept is not novel. See also: MATIC has miners, validators, and stakers. All I’m saying is everything doesn’t need a catchy name.</p>
      <p id="08">H</p>
      <p>The term <dfn>hacker</dfn> has gotten a lot of negativity, but it isn’t inherently good or bad. Plenty of hackers are gainfully employed by companies, seeking to discover vulnerabilities before other hackers and protect company assets. A hacker is simply an individual who has a drive and a passion to understand computers and software at a very intimate, granular level. “White hat hackers” are hackers who work for a company, trying to protect their assets from other hackers. “Black hat hackers” are those opposing hackers: hackers “in the wild”, seeking to find and exploit vulnerabilities. This is probably what you think of when you think of a hacker.</p>
      <p><dfn>hashcash</dfn> predates cryptocurrency and is one of the theories BTC was founded upon.</p>
      <p><dfn>hashing</dfn> is a method of encryption most alike to a base system, where you count until a certain number. You can use base 6, which would count 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13... or use base 14, which goes 8, 9, a, b, c, d, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Hashing can be decrypted through a key, but is incredibly hard to guess the underlying information without that key.</p>
      <p><dfn>Head</dfn> is a part of the hard drive disk that reads and writes information. It is held by an “arm”.</p>
      <p>A <dfn>high level language</dfn> is a programming language that is far removed from binary. You can input something like “OnPlayerTouch : Transparency = 1” and the object will disappear when touched. It’ll use English to tell what it does. Many programming favorites are high level languages, such as Java and Luau.</p>
      <p><dfn>HODL</dfn> is an abbreviation of “Hold On for Dear Life”, which references the volatility of the crypto space.</p>
      <p id="09">I</p>
      <p><dfn>ICO</dfn> (alt) is the Information Commissioner's Office - a governmental department in Britain that is their DPA (Data Protection Authority).</p>
      <p><dfn>ICP</dfn> stands for Internet Computer Protocol. Think of it like an EVM. ICP is using computing power from its nodes (which are all over its network) to make a computer. ICP tokens can be converted into “ICP Cycles”. Don’t get confused. You’re spending your tokens to make the computer do something for you. It just needs its own language because, ya know… blockchain. When you set up an ICP neuron, they lock your token rewards for the last six months of staking (and you cannot vote), so you have an incentive to consider long term implications of your vote. Rewards for voting are locked for shorter periods of time, in a neuron connected to your staked neuron, but they will not form that reward neuron until it hits 1 ICP.</p>
      <p><dfn>Immutability</dfn> means that once written, the data cannot be rewritten. It is there, in its form, forever. Even more permanent than a tattoo.</p>
      <p><dfn>Impermanent Loss</dfn> is a downfall of yield farming. Let’s say I stake 100 coins that are trading at $1 for a 12% yield for a year. Two months in, I notice that while I’ve earned 2 more coins, the price has decreased to $0.50, soI only have $51 and need to hope there will be a rebound in the price.</p>
      <p><dfn>InfoSec</dfn> is a shortening of “Information Security”, and it refers to the study and practice of keeping valuable information away from individuals who may have bad intent and want to acquire it. Cryptocurrency is, in many ways, an offshoot of the InfoSec community, as it is all about keeping information secure.</p>
      <p><dfn>Instantiation</dfn> is the creation of a new instance of something. Copying and pasting is “instantiation”.</p>
      <p id="10">J</p>
      <p id="11">K</p>
      <p>In encryption, a <dfn>key</dfn> is a sequence that you need to decrypt data. So, if I send you some data: KHMJ, and tell you to move all the letters back one space in the alphabet (to get LINK), the instructions I gave you are the key to understanding the data - KHMJ - and decrypting it to LINK.</p>
      <p><dfn>KY</dfn>” is “Know Your Customer”, and means that you have to verify your identity in an effort to prevent money laundering. Some crypto institutions practice KYC, and others do not.</p>
      <p id="12">L</p>
      <p><dfn>Laundry</dfn>, “mix”, and “tumbler” all refer to services which, by various methods, take cryptocurrency in and hide who is moving it, how much is moved, etc. Some note that a desire for privacy isn't anything new, and you probably don't want your neighbor knowing the intimate details of your finances, while others just outright say they're designed for hackers. Also, these aren't “darkweb” services; they’re not hard to find, they’re out in the open.</p>
      <p><dfn>Layer 1</dfn> in the OSI Framework is the Physical Layer. This is the physical hardware of your computer, and physical wires that link devices you can touch. Or, your wireless card.</p>
      <p><dfn>Layer 2</dfn> in the OSI Framework is the Data Link Layer. This is where two nodes (computers or devices) send and receive data over a physical connection (layer 1).</p>
      <p><dfn>Layer 3</dfn> in the OSI Framework is the Networking Layer; let’s say you have a few more than two computers. Let’s say you have thirteen or thirty… How do you send and receive data to the correct location, reliably? Computers need to have addresses and a method of sending and receiving data. This is where the Network Layer comes in. You can set up a network at home of a few devices and structure it in such a way as to reduce data loss. Or, this could be the gigantic network we know as the Internet. Either way, you have a network of data links over a physical connection.</p>
      <p><dfn>Layer 4</dfn> in the OSI Framework is the Transport Layer. This layer concerns itself with more complex methods of data transport and with the actual data that is transported over the architecture laid down in layer three. So, you’ll have the transport of data through a network of data links over a physical connection.</p>
      <p><dfn>Layer 5</dfn> in the OSI Framework is the Session Layer. In the session layer, two nodes can open a session and communicate continuously back and forth, using data transport over a network that connects devices through a physical connection (or a wireless card).</p>
      <p><dfn>Layer 6</dfn> in the OSI Framework is the Presentation Layer. In this layer, data is presented and worked with. Some applications live entirely at this level - a good example: many web pages are coded at this level. This is where you start working with data and performing programming functions. It’s less about transport, more about content. This is also where encryption and decryption usually takes place, though security should be occurring at every point in this framework. The easiest way to explain the presentation layer is “it is the ‘back end’ of your system”. So, you are (or more likely your program is) working with data that is communicated continuously using data transport over a network that connects devices through a physical connection.</p>
      <p><dfn>Layer 7</dfn> in the OSI Framework is the Application Layer. This is where you are interacting with the program and manipulating things. The user interface. So, you are interacting with a program that is working with data that is communicated continuously using data transport over a network that connects devices through a physical connection. That, my friends, is a quick technical overview of the internet. Also called a “Network Stack”.</p>
      <p>A <dfn>Layer-2 Platform</dfn> is a platform built off of a blockchain. Currently, this is popular with the ETH blockchain, with examples including MATIC.</p>
      <p><dfn>Ledger</dfn> is a record of all financial transactions performed on a specific blockchain.</p>
      <p><dfn>Leverage</dfn> is where you put up a certain amount of money - usually 1/5th, but sometimes, 1/20th, 1/100th, or even 1/500th (not allowed in most regulated markets) - for the position you want to take out. So someone could theoretically have bought 300M in $BTC with, say, $1M… but they have to have enough to cover losses. So if the loss on that account is suddenly $5M, they gotta deposit the difference. Or be “liquidated” - all their positions get closed to cover their losses. This is called a “margin call”. Sometimes, this can lower the price enough to margin call others, and… well. Happy Friday.</p>
      <p>The <dfn>Lightning Network</dfn> is a channel (another layer 2 solution), designed to work with BTC. The downside is that it can only be used for transactions, not for smart contracts. Channels work by locking up the cryptoasset and then making transactions off chain before committing them back to the chain.</p>
      <p><dfn>Liquidated</dfn> - when all of an individual account's positions get closed to cover their losses.</p>
      <p>An <dfn>LP</dfn>: there is a certain amount of any currency that is needed in a marketplace in order to facilitate transactions. Consider the bank rush in the Great Depression: everyone rushed to pull out their money, and banks couldn’t keep up, and there was a shortage in physical currency. The same could happen with cryptocurrencies, so whenever an exchange is set up, they create an “LP” - liquidity pool - which supports the need for buy and sell transactions. These LPs are intended to be locked to facilitate transactions, and to support the value of the currency.</p>
      <p id="13">M</p>
      <p>A <dfn>man-in-the-middle attack</dfn> is another very popular mode of attack, and is very self-descriptive. A hacker will ‘listen in’ on the exchange that occurs between two computers and use the information to access a wallet or to access a computer and then a wallet.
        <p><dfn>Margin call</dfn> is when an account is using leverage and suddenly needs a certain amount of money to cover losses.</p>
      <p>A <dfn>mesh topology</dfn> is one where many nodes are connected to many other nodes, and a single node failure will not affect the network. The downside to this is that there is a lot of infrastructure that has to be in place for it to work. This is why the major telecom companies really had to buy-in for the internet to boom. From a networking perspective, the blockchain takes advantage of this same topology, but from a data perspective, various topologies are being used to accomplish the goal of a decentralized, scalable, reliable data structure.</p>
      <p><dfn>Mining</dfn>: when a computer is mining a crypto currency, it is guessing at input that will produce a nice, round ending for the block that is being worked on. This can take a lot of time and a lot of computer power, so whenever the computer guesses the ending correctly, the owner is rewarded with a (usually set) amount of the currency, and the right to write the next block of data.</p>
      <p><dfn>Minting</dfn> is whatever process is in place to create one token or coin.</p>
      <p><dfn>Mt Gox</dfn> was the world’s largest BTC exchange. With 850,000 BTC in it when it shut down. It was plagued by cyber attacks and mismanagement. Little by little, the BTC had disappeared, and the person who ran Mt Gox felt that he had to keep hidden when there were cyber attacks. The owner attempted to trade his way out of trouble, and he did not succeed. Then, cyber attack after cyber attack eroded their coffers until they were empty.</p>
      <p><dfn>MultiChain Platform</dfn> is actually not what it sounds like - MultiChain is its own platform, a fork of the BTC platform, where developers can launch their own blockchains using the BTC template.</p>
      <p id="14">N</p>
      <p><dfn>Network Stack</dfn> is the combination of hardware and software that allows networks, such as the internet. See also "OSI", "Data Stack", and "Layer 1" through "Layer 7".</p>
      <p><dfn>Network topologies</dfn>, are a way of structuring nodes on a network, so as to prevent data and connection loss, minimize downtime, and improve efficiency.</p>
      <p><dfn>NFT</dfn> is a non-fungible token. It is basically the opposite of $BTC, in that no two tokens are the same, and they are not interchangeable. They are usually pieces of data, and they may be symbolized by a picture or a GIF, but what you’re actually purchasing is the data.</p>
      <p><dfn>Nicehash</dfn> is a company that proposes to help you mine crypto without all of the effort of setting up a rig etc etc. It was founded by a noteworthy hacker who is wanted by the FBI for creating a botnet. No idea how he would’ve gained access to so many computers like that. Super fascinating case.</p>
      <p>A <dfn>node</dfn> is a computer that has registered with a cryptocurrency to offer computational power to try to mine the currency or otherwise complete blocks in the blockchain. Sometimes, registering a node can be independent (like with bitcoin). Other times, setting up a node can require that you have a cold wallet with some amount of that crypto in it.</p>
      <p id="15">O</p>
      <p><dfn>Off-Ramp</dfn> is whatever mechanism you use to pull your money back out of crypto.</p>
      <p><dfn>On-Ramp</dfn> is whatever mechanism you use to trade fiat (government-issued currency like the dollar) for your crypto. Whether that is a stablecoin or simple exchange.</p>
      <p><dfn>Open Sea</dfn> is the largest online NFT marketplace.</p>
      <p><dfn>Open Source</dfn> simply means that the entire code for a cryptoasset (minus specific private keys) is publicly available - you can check over it, if you think you see a bug, or you can test a piece of code on your computer. If it behaves erroneously, you can submit that report to the developers, and they can fix it. It’s a great way to open your project to collaboration. But it’s also a great way to open your project to hacking, as someone with malicious intent may find these vulnerabilities at a faster pace than the people who have your project’s best interest at heart, and may exploit a vulnerability in the code to their benefit.</p>
        <p>An <dfn>Optimistic Rollup</dfn> performs computations and then pushes transactions onto the blockchain, allowing it to work with smart contracts.</p>
      <p><dfn>Oracles</dfn> are any source of reliable real-world information that helps a smart contract to execute itself. This can be a source of temperature information, web traffic information, etc.</p>
      <p><dfn>OSI</dfn> - that stands for the Open Systems Interconnection Networking Model. This is the most popular framework for how people understand networking. It is a theoretical model of the internet.
        <p id="16">P</p>
      <p><dfn>Pairs</dfn> are how crypto is traded on many platforms. These could be DASH/USDT, DASH/USDC, or DASH/USD ; this means you are trading one commodity for another - either tethers, coins, or straight US dollars to get your DASH. This is an important concept for every reader, because at the end of the day, all of your stocks trade this way too. When you trade, you’re not just making a statement about what you think the stock will do (to the moon!), you’re making a statement about what you think the dollar might do (to the basement!). We call them trades for a reason: you are literally trading your dollars for a slice of a company.</p>
      <p><dfn>Permissionless</dfn> is a system that is public. Usually, these do not require identity verification to transact on, like the BTC or ETH blockchains.</p>
  <p><dfn>Ping</dfn> occurs when one computer queries another computer on a network to test the connection.</p>
  <p><dfn>Plasma</dfn> is a layer-2 solution also known as a “commit chain”. Plasma uses parent-child chains. In some coding languages, there are parents and children. Children have some qualities of the parent, but are distinct things themselves. Just like your kids, if you have them. Apples and Bananas are both fruit; they’re both sweet and contain fructose and fiber but they are not the same things. Sometimes, there are things that affect the parent chain and get broadcast back to it; like perhaps a virus that’s killing all the fruit in the area. But mostly, they operate independently.</p>
  <p><dfn>Pool Mining</dfn> is when you pool your computer in with others in order to mine, because you feel that’s the best way to go about it. Mom is not a fan of pool mining. While there is pool mining software designed to keep you safe, you’re inherently giving more and more people access to a piece of your computer, and that just generally isn’t a safe idea. Also, some of the software and services have less than savory characters leading them, which makes the first point even more concerning. Then to add to that, if your computer isn’t fancy enough to compete with BTC, my general recommendation is to find a crypto that is minable that is earlier on that you feel bullish on, mine that, and then work your way up to mining other currencies with rigs you designed and paid for by bootstrapping your mining operation. There may be a day where I change my mind and I feel like this is a safe venture, but at this juncture, I think it’s generally unsafe and I’m going to be transparent about that bias.</p>
   <p><dfn>Private Blockchains</dfn> are used within organizations and are not made public. Companies with large sets of data in data centers are the most common users of this technology.</p>
   <p>A <dfn>program</dfn> is anything that runs on your computer that takes input and performs a function - that is, it does something. It might be processing a word document, playing a shooting game, accessing a web page… programs are everywhere. Some programs store data. Some programs store a relatively small amount of data and keep performing their functions. Other programs store massive amounts of data (a photo library, for instance.)</p>
  <p><dfn>Proof of Capacity</dfn> is an alternative to BTC’s proof of work. Rather than all the computers competing to find the value that will end the data on the blockchain nicely, in a PoC system, each computer is given a list of endings to try out randomly. The more space your computer has, the longer the list of endings it gets to try. Whoever gets the nice, round ending wins the right to write the next block, and gets the reward.</p>
  <p><dfn>Proof of Correctness</dfn> is a mechanism by which a node is incentivized to be in the majority whenever consensus is reached. This could be with increasing rewards as more instances of being in the majority occur, or it could be that if a node is shown to be faulty or acting maliciously, it is removed from the system. AVAX uses this system.</p>
  <p><dfn>Proof of Elapsed Time</dfn> is intended to keep energy use low. This mechanism actually comes from Intel. If you have 5 nodes in the network, they will all get a number from 1-5. Blocks usually take a certain amount of time to write, so once each node has its number, it knows how long it will have to wait, and it is required to turn off until it’s that node’s turn. So, if your node gets number 4, and each block takes 10 minutes to write, it has to turn off for 40 minutes, until its number is called and it turns on and does some work. After all the blocks have been formed, the numbers are redrawn.</p>
  <p><dfn>Proof of Stake</dfn> is an alternative to “Proof of Work”. In proof of stake, rather than competing with a bunch of other miners for the rights to write the next block on the chain, and being rewarded with the currency that you’re mining, which could have 5 or 7 or even 7000 computers all running 24/7 competing for those rights, in Proof of Stake, either by holding more currency than others who are staking or by holding one of the coins and being chosen at random, your node gains the rights to write the next block on the chain. This means fewer wasted computational resources, and as an extra incentive to stake, most cryptocurrencies offer a specific percentage yearly.</p>
  <p><dfn>Proof of Uptime</dfn> is a mechanism by which a node is required to check-in at specified intervals and prove that they are contributing. AVAX uses PoU alongside a Proof of Correctness.</p>
  <p><dfn>Proof of Work</dfn>: in assets like $BTC, many computers are trying to guess at what numbers they can end a block of data with to produce a nice, round, ending and form the block of data cleanly. When a computer does guess correctly, it's said to have accomplished proof of work. It is rewarded with being able to write the next block of data and getting a certain amount of the asset it is mining. Users will often work together with many computers in order to try to gain this reward.</p>
  <p><dfn>Pseudorandom</dfn> is literally falsely random. That is, it seems random, it meets qualifications for being random mathematically, but it’s not. It’s arrived at by a definite mathematical procedure which is done, but secret to the computer. Here, I’ll give you an example: 13, 27, 8, 11, 15, 21, 2, 12, 18 – were those random? Well, perhaps to you, but to me, they are digits which form birthdays of people important to me. They may even meet technical qualifications for randomness, but they are definitely not random.</p>
  <p id="17">Q</p>
  <p><dfn>Query</dfn> is when a person or program is searching a database (a collection of data) for a specific type or subset of data.</p>
  <p id="18">R</p>
  <p><dfn>Reflections</dfn> were all the rage early in 2021. Basically, out of every transaction processed, a small percentage goes to the processor (the cryptoproject). Some crypto projects take that percent and burn it to induce scarcity, but others redistribute that percentage to anyone holding the asset. They call this a “reflection”.</p>

"Relational Data": there are a lot of different ways to sort and organize the data that you have, but there is one particular divide worth noting: Relational and non-relational. Relational may be used for data that you think (or know) is directly related - a phone number and a name, the temperature and the rate of pool usage; non-relational data is data which either definitely isn’t related or is perhaps spuriously related; photographs, drawings, or the price of tea in China, for example.

A “ring topology” is one where nodes are connected like a bus topology, except the last node reconnects to the first. This used to be fairly popular in networking, but has fallen out of favor. In fact, they all have fallen out of favor, except for mesh. The benefit to this was that, if there was a single node failure, unlike the bus topology, you could still find a way to send data (just sending it backward). The downside was that a single failure was still a significant event.

A "Rollup" is one way to build a layer-2 platform, which comes in two flavors: a “zk-Rollup”, or an "Optimistic Rollup". A zk-Rollup pushes the computing onto the blockchain, and so is very fast, but an Optimistic Rollup allows for smart contracts.

“RugDoc” If you’re unsure about a token and you see the project and you’re going “wow, they’re promising me a ride in Jeff Bezo’s Spaceship for a mere $1k; I kind of feel wary about this.”, there’s a website that can help you to determine if the underlying code to a yield farming project is malicious. Rugdoc.io is a great resource for doing your due diligence, especially as most of us (myself included) aren’t InfoSec developers.

A "Rugpull” is a charged word in the crypto community, and it happens when a creator or developer of a cryptoasset takes the LP (liquidity pool), exchanges it for another currency, and runs away.

S

“Scrypt” is the algorithm that makes LTC and DOGE work. It is the mathematical formula that underlies the actual block creation.

“Server” is a computer with more resources than it will need as its own device; servers traditionally have. Whereas computers tend to start off at 4GB of RAM, a server will start off at 32 GB. It has more resources so that it can lend them out to other computers who need them. We call this the “server-client” relationship or the server-client model.

A "sidechain" is another layer 2 solution, which branches off of the main blockchain, uses a virtual computer to perform functions and smart contracts; and then sends information back to the blockchain through a bridge contract.

A "Single Point of Failure" is the term given to a point which, if it fails, brings down the whole system or network. A SPOF is a bad thing, and many systems are built with redundancies to try to prevent it.

"Smart Contracts” In coding, there is something called “i, v” ; an “i, v” is basically an “if, then” statement. It is widely used, and examples may include: “if balance over $24, issue 1 $20 bill and deduct $4 fee” for an ATM, or “if coins over $2000, allow the purchase of gold walls” in a video game. A smart contract takes advantage of this function, and allows you to automate a traditional contract. Basically, you can write a piece of code based upon an “i, v” statement that will facilitate a transaction automatically and cut out the intermediaries (lawyers, accountants, etc). It’s basically an ATM, but you can make things very simple or you can make them very complex.

"Social Hacking" is the term given to the hardest form of hacking to prevent: hacking which relies on trust in other people, and relationships that are built intentionally to gain access to digital assets that the hacker is not supposed to be able to access.

“Sovereignty of the Blockchain” is an interesting concept. At the end of the day, each individual blockchain is its own sovereign. Right now, there is no way to un-hash hashed data; no way, other than obtaining the private key, to access cryptoassets. So once an asset is on the blockchain, it cannot be seized by a government or the courts. There is no civil forfeiture, there is no room for lawsuits. A court might demand it and threaten prison, but ultimately, if the owner doesn’t give up the private key, those funds are just gonna sit there.

“Speed, Security, and Decentralization” are touted as the three most important goals of any crypto project, and often wind up with contradictory goals. Something that is more secure and decentralized is generally slower. Something that is fast usually is making sacrifices either in security or in decentralization.

“SQL” is Structured Query Language - it is the language that most raw data (mostly spreadsheets) is written in, and it gives you statistical tools to help you use that data. Most likely, most of your information on the internet is in some kind of SQL database. Your credit card numbers, your information on a mailing list, your incoming and outgoing bank transactions, where your character is in a video game… that’s likely all SQL data.

“Stablecoin” is any coin that is pegged (or tied) to a physical, tangible asset, whether that is gold, or the US dollar, or the Japanese Yuan.

“Staking” is where you lock a certain amount (chosen by you) of the cryptocurrency in your wallet.

“State Channel” is a solution for the problem of slow networking on some blockchains. There is a sidechain (a channel) that records the status of many small transactions (the state of your currency), before lumping them all together to make a transaction. So, if you plan to buy several assets, you might open a state channel, make all your purchases, and then close it, only paying for 1 transaction instead of several. MATIC uses state channels.

A “star topology” is one where nodes are connected to other nodes in the form of a star: one at the center and many surrounding it. The biggest weakness with this topology is that the center presents a Single Point of Failure. If the center fails, everything goes down. The biggest advantage is that the center can take on a lot of the ‘load’ of the network, provided it has exceptional resources. $ATOM is using this topology in regards to their blockchain data.

In “Symmetric Encryption”, the key used to BOTH encrypt and decrypt data is private and the same. This becomes a problem as that key also has to be communicated in some way - either known to both parties prior or communicated with the message. All that is needed to translate the data is that private key, and a hacker can look at all the underlying information.

T

“Tendermint” is a part of Cosmos (ATOM), and serves as the underpinnings for the network. Basically, if Cosmos is Windows, where you can turn on your computer and use the OS to run programs, then Tendermint is the firmware that lets Windows run. MATIC is also built on Tendermint.

“Testnet” is a testing grounds for blockchains, where developers can test if their level 2 solution will work.

"Tokenomics” is the study of the particular mechanisms/workings of a token, and of the supply and demand of crypto as a whole.

“Total Supply” is the term for the total number of coins or tokens that will ever be available, in a capped currency or token.

“Trustless”: our world is based upon trust. You may not realize it, but it is. You fundamentally trust (to differing extents) your bank, your government, your credit card provider, and anyone you do business with. Just imagine some guy - let’s call him “Dave” - approaching you at a gas station. He says, “Hey there, if you sign up with me, I’ll hold onto your money for you and I’ll give you $50 for signing up if you deposit $300 with me.” Would you give out your personal information (and your money) to Dave? Probably not. But big banks routinely run this offer. They have mass public trust. Well, let’s say I’m a little skeptical. I’ve seen the whole Weñls Fargo scandal. I don’t necessarily find them any more trustworthy. What can I do? This is where a “trustless” system comes in. It might be better defined as “trust but verify”. A trustless system allows you to clearly and openly see all transactions. If someone says they have $10M, you can verify that by going and looking at their wallet. There is no middle man - no Visa, no Wells Fargo, so you don’t have to trust them to perform a transaction. Because, let’s face it… there are a lot of Dave’s, and not all of them are people.

“Trustless Quoroms” are a device used by DASH, wherein a specific number of pseudorandom nodes are chosen to perform an operation and reach a consensus, protecting against 51% attacks and bad actors by only having some nodes perform the operation and reach consensus.

U

“Unmineable” is crypto mining software which allows you to mine coins which are not traditionally mineable, like CRO or SFM. It does this by mining something that IS mineable and automatically swapping for the coin that isn’t mineable.

An “unstoppable domain” is an ENS that would work on chains other than ETH. Currently, one is being deployed on MATIC.

V

"Validator” is a node (computer) that is responsible for ensuring the correctness of transactions before they are added to the ledger (blockchain).

A “Vampire Project” is a project which copies and pastes another with superficial changes in an attempt to steal the user base of a platform. With coins (which have their own blockchain) this is generally considered ok, but with tokens (which do not have their own blockchain and get their value through liquidity), it is considered impolite. SUSHI is widely considered to have been a vampire project, basing itself on UNISWAP.

“Vesting” in cryptoassets is when a certain portion of the assets which were locked is released into circulation

A “Virtual Machine” is a way to use software to make one computer behave like it is two computers. Perhaps you want to use a different operating system, or you’re a company and you have vast amounts of computing resources that you know you’ll need as you scale, but you aren’t using right now, so you’d like to rent out some of those resources and make some extra revenue. Or you have one nicer computer and two monitors and you want to play a game against a precocious young child. All these things can be accomplished with a virtual machine.

“Vitali Buterin” is one of the co-creators of ETH and has been a prominent public figure.

W

“Web 3” Let's start first with Web 1, which was a bunch of mostly plaintext, HTML, and CSS web pages. Old school web. But then, the web got smarter. There were applications that could run within a web page, that allowed greater functionality. Then with sites like Facebook and Twitter, the web became an interactive type of thing: large databases of user-generated content, managed in part by machine learning algorithms. In Web 3, the proposal is that it will lean even more on AI/ML algorithms, and will be decentralized, instead of all the data (and therefore power) being with corporations.

A “White Paper” is the foundation document for a cryptocurrency, which outlines its structure, its current rules for governance, its use-case, etc etc. Some of these are fairly cogent documents; they’re clearly written, concise, and about 2 pages. Some are weighty and difficult to read, and can span across multiple separate documents or generally seem fairly daunting. For reference, $BTC has a 9-page white paper. It’s a fairly easy read and available here: https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf ; I’ve covered most of the jargon that it uses.

A "wrapped” token is a token that is meant to be used on a different blockchain. You can wrap BTC in order to use it on the ETH chain, for example. To do this, usually, you’ll turn a BTC over to a smart contract, which will issue the appropriate number of ETH.

“Yield Farming” is a crypto strategy where you place your crypto in an LP or staking program to earn a yield, you then harvest that yield and move somewhere with a higher yield.

A “Zero-Day Exploit” is every developer and programmer’s worst nightmare. It is an exploit they have zero days to fix, because it is actively being used against them (it is "found in the wild") by the time it is discovered. There was actually a fairly recent Zero-Day Exploit that involved hackers using a javascript exploit to get into Microsoft Servers and use it to mine a certain unnamed cryptocurrency. (An act known as “Cryptojacking”.) 
"Zero-knowledge proof” is proof which indicates nothing about the underlying information. Think of it as a receipt, with your debit card number starred out, and whatever you bought also obscured, along with the amount. You have the receipt, which verifies a transaction occurred, but the details are secured away from being findable. 
"Zerocash": an earlier cryptoasset that attempted to provide some privacy, but was improved upon by ZCash.
A "zk-Rollup", or zero-knowledge rollup, bundles a lot of different smaller moves into one big move. Think of it like if 100 people want to buy 1% of an ETH; you can bundle all that up, and just buy 1 ETH.  It's fast, because it pushes the computing onto the blockchain, but it cannot work with smart contracts.

A "51% Attack" is the most commonly known vulnerability to blockchains and is used to accomplish double-spending. This is where a malicious actor has control over more than half of the nodes in the network and can simply change the information on the blockchain ledger to benefit him/her. Some cryptos may be more vulnerable to this, but any crypto with a significant market share is going to be so distributed that the chances of a malicious actor being able to control so many different computers is low. It’s like the chances of your entire city - without prior discussion - deciding to leave their doors unlocked.
